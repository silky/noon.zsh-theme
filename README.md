## Installation

You can install it via say zgen:

```
zgen load silky/noon.zsh-theme noon.zsh-theme
```

### Features

- Cool physics symbol: Ï†

- Error code appears when error; and terminal goes red.

- Terminal also goes red when in sudo

- Also includes [Konsole colour
scheme](https://github.com/silky/noon.zsh-theme/blob/master/konsole-Noon-Light.colorscheme)
which is neccessary because we use colour names now. Put it in
`~/.local/share/konsole` to use it.

### Notes

- If you use vim, this almost certainly depends on my [vim
colourscheme](https://github.com/silky/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/colors/noon-light.vim).
